# Handling FormData

In some cases, you might want to handle `FormData` directly in your server actions, especially when working with forms in client-side components. `zsa` supports `FormData` as an input type, making it easy to integrate form submissions with your server actions.

## Server Action with FormData

Here's an example of how to create a server action that accepts `FormData`:

```typescript:actions.ts
"use server"

import { createServerAction } from "zsa"
import z from "zod"

export const myFormDataAction = createServerAction()
    .input(z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        email: z.string()
    }), {
        type: "formData"  <|highlight|>
    })
    .handler(async ({ input }) => {
        // Process the input data
        return {
            message: `Received data: ${input.name}, ${input.email}`
        };
    });
```

In this example, the server action `myFormDataAction` is configured to accept `FormData` by specifying the `type: "formData"` option. The `input` schema defines the expected fields and their types.

## Form data client example

To call this server action from a client component, you can use a standard HTML form with the `action` attribute set to the server action function:

```typescript:form-example.tsx
"use client"

import { myFormDataAction } from "./actions";
import { useRef } from "react";

export default function FormExample() {
    return (
        <form
            action={myFormDataAction}
        >
            <label>
                Name:
                <input type="text" name="name" required />
            </label>
            <label>
                Email:
                <input type="email" name="email" required />
            </label>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
}
```

- The form's `action` attribute is set to the server action function, `myFormDataAction`.
- `useRef` is used to create a reference to the form element.
- The `onSubmit` handler prevents the default form submission behavior, creates a `FormData` object from the form, and calls the server action with this data.
- The response is logged to the console.

This setup allows you to handle form submissions seamlessly, leveraging the type safety and validation provided by `zsa`.

Here is the result:

<ExampleComponent id="form-data" />
